Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    6
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         421 out of  17,344    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          213
    Number used as Latches:             208
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,395 out of  17,344    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            938 out of   8,672   10%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     938 out of     938 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     938   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,439 out of  17,344    8%
    Number used as logic:             1,395
    Number used as a route-thru:         44

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
