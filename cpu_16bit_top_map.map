WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net u5/rega_not0001 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         420 out of  17,344    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          389
    Number used as Latches:              31
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,206 out of  17,344    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            905 out of   8,672   10%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     905 out of     905 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     905   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,251 out of  17,344    7%
    Number used as logic:             1,206
    Number used as a route-thru:         45

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
